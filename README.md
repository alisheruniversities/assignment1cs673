CS673 Assignment 1

Overview

This assignment consists of five programming tasks that involve basic computational and logical operations. Each task has been implemented in Python and stored in separate files:

part1cs673.py - Multiplication Table

part2cs673.py - Palindrome Check

part3cs673.py - Combine Strings

part4cs673.py - Fibonacci Sequence

part5cs673.py - Leap Year Check

Tasks Description

1. Multiplication Table (part1cs673.py)

Points: 5

The program prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.

The output consists of a formatted table displaying multiplication results.

2. Palindrome Check (part2cs673.py)

Points: 5

The program asks the user to input a string and determines if it is a palindrome.

Outputs either The string is a palindrome. or The string is not a palindrome.

If the user enters q, the program exits.

3. Combine Strings (part3cs673.py)

Points: 5

The program prompts the user to input two lists in the format [a,b,c], [1,2,3].

Checks if both lists have equal length; if not, an error message is displayed.

If valid, it merges the lists alternately, e.g., [a,1,b,2,c,3].

4. Fibonacci Sequence (part4cs673.py)

Points: 5

The program computes and prints the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

Fibonacci numbers are generated using the formula: F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1) with F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1.

5. Leap Year Check (part5cs673.py)

Points: 5

The program determines whether an input year is a leap year.

Leap year conditions:

Divisible by 4

Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400
